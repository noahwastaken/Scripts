<br>
Hi! I hope that the V6 SuperCharger script is working well for you!<br>
<br>
<b>Did this file just auto load?</b> If so, you have init.d boot scripts working and there are 3 reasons why this could happen:<br>
1. You're <u>not</u> 100% SuperCharged and minfrees <u>don't match</u>! If this is the case, <u><b>READ</b></u> this entire help file - <u><b>BEFORE</b></u> asking redundant questions!</u>. Also check /data/BootLog_SuperCharger.log and /data/Ran_SuperCharger.log!<br>
2. You set Wheel Alignment or Fix Alignment to run on boot but you don't have the zipalign binary installed. Get it by installing the <a href="http://goo.gl/1JPl8">SuperCharger Starter Kit</a>. Also check /data/BootLog_ZepAlign.log or /data/BootLog_FixAlign.log!<br>
3. You set Detailing to run on boot but you don't have the sqlite3 binary installed. Get it by installing the <a href="http://goo.gl/1JPl8">SuperCharger Starter Kit</a>. Also check /data/BootLog_Detailing.log!<br>
<br>
Here is some <b><u>Background Info</u></b> in case you're curious...<br>
<br>
<a href="http://goo.gl/krtf9">Linux Memory Consumption</a> - Nice article!<br>
<a href="http://goo.gl/hFdNO">Memory and SuperCharging Overview</a>, or... "Why 'Free RAM' Is NOT Wasted RAM!"<br>
<a href="http://goo.gl/4w0ba">MFK Calculator Info</a> - explanation for <b>vm.min_free_kbytes</b><br>

<a href="http://goo.gl/Zc85j">Entropy-ness Enlarger Musings...</a> - Possible reasons why it may actually do something :p<br>
<br>
<u><b>Patching services.jar/odex for ALL ROMS:</b></u>: It actually has 3 Mods. See the <a href="http://goo.gl/IvGL1">-=Ultimatic Jar Patcher Tools=-</a> thread.<br>
Mod 1. "Jelly ISCream" for ICS, Jelly Bean and above. This will SuperCharge Your Home Launcher and ADJ/OOM Priorities!<br>
Mod 2. "Maximum MultiTasking Mods" for Froyo and above<br>
Mod 3. "Non-Sense App Limit" for Sense 4 and above (Not needed for Sense 3.6 and below).<br>
<br>
Ok... now be sure to have <a href="http://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.jrummy.busybox.installer">BusyBox</a> installed or else the scripts won't work!<br>
Most custom roms should already have a version installed and that usually works OK.<br>
So if you need to, only install <b>BusyBox v1.16.2 or higher!</b><br>
Note that some versions above v1.18.2 and below v1.19.1 sometimes give errors so <u>PAY ATTENTION</u> to the script output!<br>
Versions above v1.19.0 should be fine though.<br>
If all else fails or if you get "<b>applet not found</b>" errors, just grab BusyBox from the <a href="http://goo.gl/qM6yR">V6 SuperCharger Thread!</a><br>
Or even better, get the <b>SuperCharger Starter Kit!</b>
<br>
A nice app for running the script is <a href="http://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=os.tools.scriptmanager">Script Manager</a><br>
It can even load scripts on boot - on ANY ROM!<br>
Plus, it even has WIDGETS!<br>
So you can actually put a V6 SuperCharger shortcut on your desktop, launch it, and have a quick peek at your current status!<br>
<br>
But first, you need to set up Script Manager properly!<br>
In the "Config" settings, enable "Browse as Root."<br>
Then browse to where you saved the V6 SuperCharger script, select it, and in the script's properties box, be sure to select "Run as Root" ie. SuperUser!<br>
<b>Do NOT run this file at boot!</b> (You don't want to run the install on every boot, do you?)<br>
Run the V6 SuperCharger script, touch the screen to access the soft keyboard, and enter your choice :)<br>
<br>
<u><b>Stock ROMs</b></u>: After running the script, have Script Manager load the newly created <b>/data/99SuperCharger.sh</b> on boot<br>
In the "Config" settings, be sure that "Browse as Root" is enabled.<br>
Press the menu key and then Browser. Navigate up to the root, then click on the "data" folder.<br>
Click on 99SuperCharger.sh and select "Script" from the "Open As" menu.<br>
In the properties dialogue box, check "Run as root" (SuperUser) and "Run at boot" and "Save".<br>
And that's it!<br>
Script Manager will load your most recent settings on boot!<br>
If you run the script later and with different settings, you don't have to reconfigure anything.<br>
Script Manager will just load the new /data/99SuperCharger.sh on boot automagically ;^]<br>
<br>
<u><b>Custom ROMs</b></u>: If you have a custom rom that loads /system/etc/init.d boot scripts,<br>
You DON'T need to use Script Manager to load a boot script. It will all be automatic!<br>
Also, if you can run boot scripts from the /system/etc/init.d folder, there are other options.<br>
For example you can use an app like Terminal Emulator to run the script.<br>
<u>PRE-ICS ROMS</u>: If your ROM has the option, <b>DISABLE "Lock Home In Memory.</b> This takes effect immediately.<br>
Alternately, <u>if you need to free up extra ram</u>, you can use "Lock Home in Memory" as a "Saftey Lock".<br>
ie. Use it to toggle your launcher from "Bulletproof" (0) or Hard To Kill (1) to "Weak" (2) in the event that you want to make the launcher an easy kill and free up extra RAM ;)<br>
<br>
<u><b>If Settings Don't Stick:</b></u> If you have Auto Memory Manager, DISABLE SuperUser permissions and if you have AutoKiller Memory Optimizer, DISABLE the apply settings at boot option!<br>
Also, if you have a <b>Custom ROM</b>, there might be something in the init.d folder that interferes with priorities and minfrees.<br>
If you can't find the problem, a quick fix is to have Script Manager run <b>/system/etc/init.d/*99SuperCharger</b> "at boot" and "as root."<br>
<br>
Another option is to make a Script Manager widget for <b>/system/etc/init.d/*99SuperCharger</b> or <b>/data/99SuperCharger.sh</b> on your homescreen and simply launch it after each reboot.<br>
<br>
For those with a <b>Milestone</b>, I made a version for <b>Androidiani Open Recovery</b> too :D<br>
Just extract the zip to the root of $storage (it contains the directory structure), load AOR, and there will be a SuperCharger Menu on the main screen! <br>

# Usage: 1. Runs automatically via custom rom's init.d folder or BulletProof Apps Service.
#        2. Type in Terminal: "su" and enter, "/data/97*" and enter.
#        3. Script Manager: launch it once like any other script OR with a widget (DO NOT PUT IT ON A SCHEDULE!)
#
# Important! Whether you run this with Terminal or Script Manager or widget, the script relaunches and kills itself after $bpwait seconds (default is 30 seconds).
#            So you can close the app after that time and BulletProof Apps continues in the background!
#
# Note: To customize BulletProof frequency, change the "bpwait" variable to the number of seconds you want.
#       Valid value is any whole number (no decimals) over 0.
#       If 0, it won't re-execute :P heh.
#       If the value is invalid or missing, it defaults to running every 30 seconds.
#       Example: If you want it to run every minute, make the line read "bpwait=60;".
#       WARNING: Making it too low may suck your battery faster than an Armstrong on a steroid. So don't be a nut.
#                14s is likely the lowest you should need to go so that nothing ever gets killed.
#
# To verify that it's running, type in Terminal:
# 1. "pstree | grep Bullet" - for init.d script or usage option 2 (with Terminal)
# 2. "pstree | grep sleep" - if using the service or usage option 3 (with Script Manager)
# 3. "grep -h [B]ullet /proc/*/cmdline" - Sure-Fire method ;^]
#     The output should be 2 items:
#         a. "/path/to/*97BulletProof_Apps*"
#         b. "BulletProof_Apps_is_In_Effect!" (sleep message)
# 4. "busybox ps | grep [B]ullet" would give similar results as 3.
#
# This script loads a list of apps via /data/V6_SuperCharger/BulletProof_Apps_HitList.
# You can easily add to or edit the HitList right from your device!
# Just enter a unique segment of the proces name! However, the more info you give, the better ;^]
#
# This ALSO loads /data/V6_SuperCharger/BulletProof_Apps_Fine_Tuner.sh.
# Read the comments in that file for "Fine Tuning" instrucions!

# Usage: 1. Type in Terminal: "su" and enter, "/data/V6*/Bullet*/1Shot*" and enter. (This runs all 1Shot scripts)
#        2. Script Manager: launch it once like any other script OR with a widget (DO NOT PUT IT ON A SCHEDULE!)
#
# Important! Whether you run this with Terminal or Script Manager or widget, the script relaunches and kills itself after $bpwa1t seconds (default is 30 seconds).
#            So you can close the app after that time and the BulletProof "One-Shot" continues in the background!
#
# Note: To customize BulletProof frequency, change the "bpwa1t" variable to the number of seconds you want.
#       Valid value is any whole number (no decimals) over 0.
#       If 0, it won't re-execute :P heh.
#       If the value is invalid or missing, it defaults to running every 30 seconds.
#       Example: If you want it to run every minute, make the line read "bpwa1t=60;".
#       WARNING: Making it too low may suck your battery faster than an Armstrong on a steroid. So don't be a nut.
#                14s is likely the lowest you should need to go so that nothing ever gets killed.
#
# To verify that it's running, just run the script again!
# OR you can type in Terminal:
# 1. "pstree | grep 1Shot" - for usage option 1 (with Terminal)
# 2. "pstree | grep sleep" - for usage option 2 (with Script Manager)
# 3. "grep -h [1]Shot /proc/*/cmdline" - Sure-Fire method ;^]
#     The output should be 2 items:
#         a. "/data/V6_SuperCharger/BulletProof_One_Shots/1Shot-$bpappname.sh"
#         b. "1Shot-$bpappname_is_In_Effect!" (sleep message)

# Use this file to "Fine Tune" App Priorities to your liking!
#
# The possible values of oom_adj range from -17 to 15.
# Newer kernels use oom_score_adj instead with values from -1000 to 1000.
# The higher the score, more likely the associated process is to be killed by OOM-killer.
# Basically, the conversion to the new system is oldstyle*1000/17 and the decimal is truncated.
# So if something had an ADJ of 6, it would now be 6*1000/17=352.94118... which truncates down to 352.
#
# A niceness (effects CPU Time) of -20 is the highest priority and 19 is the lowest priority.
# A higher priority process will get a larger chunk of the CPU time than a lower priority process.
# 0 is usually the default niceness for processes and is inherited from its parent process.
#
# In this script, by default, all apps have priorities applied as follows:
# echo -17 > /proc/\`pgrep *com.app.name*\`/oom_adj
# echo -1000 > /proc/\`pgrep *com.app.name*\`/oom_score_adj (one or the other will apply lol)
# renice -10 \`pgrep *com.app.name*\`
# The renice of -10 should be sufficient to keep it snappy but not interfere with other apps that you're using ;^]
#
# At the opposite end, if you wanted something to get killed off easily, you can change it to:
# echo 15 > /proc/\`pgrep *com.app.name*\`/oom_adj
# echo 1000 > /proc/\`pgrep *com.app.name*\`/oom_score_adj (for newer kernels)
# renice 19 \`pgrep *com.app.name*\`
#
# Typically, an app's (Secondary Servers) values (when SuperCharged) are:
# echo 6 > /proc/\`pgrep *com.app.name*\`/oom_adj
# echo 352 > /proc/\`pgrep *com.app.name*\`/oom_score_adj (for newer kernels)
# renice 0 \`pgrep *com.app.name*\`

# ZipAligns all data and system apks (apps) that have not yet been ZipAligned.
# ZipAlign optimizes all your apps, resulting in less RAM comsumption and a faster device! ;^]
#
# Option 1. By default, this will check and/or zipalign only apks which were recently added and may need it.
# Option 2. Or, when asked, you can force it to zipalign all apks! (Obviously, this takes a bit longer).
#
# The code is HIGHLY optimized... so it's REALLY FAST!
#
# Get full stats from the log file!
#
# Tweaks & Enhancements by zeppelinrox...
#      - Added BRAINS: By default, it will only check apks that were added since last run (ie. newer than the log file!)
#      - Added support for /vendor/app (POST-ICS).
#      - Added support for /mnt/asec.
#      - Added support for more data directories ie. dbdata, datadata, etc.
#      - Added debugging.
#      - Enhanced logging!
#      - Tweaked interface... just a wittle bit ;^]
#
# Props: Automatic ZipAlign by Wes Garner (original script)
#        oknowton for the change from MD5 to zipalign -c 4

# The code is HIGHLY optimized... so it's REALLY FAST!
#
# Get full stats from the log file!
#
# Tweaks & Enhancements by zeppelinrox...
#      - Added BRAINS: By default, it will only check apks that were added since last run (ie. newer than the log file!)
#      - Added support for /vendor/app (POST-ICS).

#
# Credit imoseyon for making the drop caches command more well known :)
# See http://www.droidforums.net/forum/liberty-rom-d2/122733-tutorial-sysctl-you-guide-better-preformance-battery-life.html
# Credit dorimanx (Cool XDA dev!) for the neat idea to show before and after stats :D
#
# Usage: 1. Type in Terminal: "su" and enter, "flush" and enter. ("flush" is indentical to !FastEngineFlush.sh but easier to type :p)
#        2. Script Manager: launch it once like any other script OR with a widget (DO NOT PUT IT ON A SCHEDULE!)
#
# Important! Whether you run this with Terminal or Script Manager or widget, the script relaunches and kills itself after the first run.
#            So let it run ONCE, close the app, and "Engine Flush-O-Matic" continues in the background!
#
# Note: To enable "Engine Flush-O-Matic" mode, change the "flushOmaticHours" variable to the number of hours you want.
#       Valid values are from 1 to 24 (hours).
#       Decimal values ARE valid! ie. .1 = 6 minutes, .25 = 15 minutes, 2.5 = 2 hrs and 30 minutes (2.5 hrs duh).
#       If 0, or if the value is invalid or missing, "Engine Flush-O-Matic" mode is disabled.
#       Example: If you want it to run every 4 hours and 30 minutes, make the line read "flushOmaticHours=4.5".
#
# To verify that it's running, just run the script again!
# OR you can type in Terminal:
# 1. "pstree | grep -i flus" - for usage option 1 (with Terminal)
# 2. "pstree | grep sleep" - for usage option 2 (with Script Manager)
# 3. "grep -hi [f]lush /proc/*/cmdline" - Sure-Fire method ;^]
#     The output should be 2 items:
#         a. "/data/V6_SuperCharger/!FastEngineFlush.sh" OR "/system/etc/init.d/96superflush" OR "/system/xbin/flush"(depending on which script ran)
#         b. "Engine_Flush-O-Matic_is_In_Effect!" (sleep message)
# 4. "busybox ps | grep -i [f]lus" would give similar results as 3.

Yay! You already have <a href="http://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=os.tools.scriptmanager">Script Manager!</a><br>
After running the script, have Script Manager load the newly created <b>/data/99SuperCharger.sh</b> on boot<br>
In the "Config" settings, enable "Browse as Root."<br>
Press the menu key and then Browser.<br>
Navigate up to the root, then click on the "data" folder.<br>
Click on 99SuperCharger.sh and select "Script" from the "Open As" menu.<br>
In the properties dialogue box, check "Run as root" (ie. SuperUser) and "Run at boot" and "Save".<br>
And that's it!<br>
Script Manager will load your most recent settings on boot!<br>
<br>
Another option is to make a Script Manager widget for <b>/data/99SuperCharger.sh</b> on your homescreen and simply launch it after each reboot.<br>
<br>
If you run the script later and with different settings, you don't have to reconfigure anything.<br>
Script Manager will just load the new /data/99SuperCharger.sh on boot automagically ;^]<br>

To enable init.d boot scripts, go <a href="http://goo.gl/rZTyW">HERE</a><br>
This is for Motorolas! At least some of them anyway.<br>
If that page is incompatible with your phone, do some reasearch!<br>
<br>
A very nice and easy solution is to simply use<br>
Script Manager to load scripts on boot - on ANY ROM!<br>
Here is the <a href="http://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=os.tools.scriptmanager">Google Play Link</a><br>
So first, you use Script Manager to run the V6 SuperCharger script.<br>
Then use it again to load the newly created <b>/data/99SuperCharger.sh</b> on boot<br>
In the 99SuperCharger.sh properties dialogue box, check "Run as root" (ie. SuperUser) and "Run at boot" and "Save".<br>
And that's it!<br>
Script Manager will load your most recent settings on boot!<br>
<br>
Another option is to make a Script Manager widget for <b>/data/99SuperCharger.sh</b> on your homescreen and simply launch it after each reboot.<br>
<br>
If you run the script later and with different settings, you don't have to reconfigure anything.<br>
Script Manager will just load the new /data/99SuperCharger.sh on boot automagically ;^]<br>
